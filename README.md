## Description

This is a old project form 2003. Here is the about and help response that I wrote back then:

> This program associates folders, programs and many more with keywords. It is designed for removing all shortcuts from your desktop and start menu. Because you will never need them again. You can set a keyword like "ie" for Internet Explorer and you can run it just typing ie! With eaxTerm you will never search icons that are hidden who know where!
> 
>With eaxTerm, you can run dos and system commands, open documents, surf the web and send e-mails easy as writing e-mail addresses!
>
> And you can costumize eaxTerm in the way you like, please take a look at available commands and try to find your best!
> 
> Whenever, whereever you are when you need eaxTerm, just press the key that has Winindows logo on it and S ("Win+S"). eaxTerm will come along and save the day!
> 
> Bars that at the end of the window are memory bars, the left presents your total memory limit and usage and the right presents your physcal memory.
>
>To add your links, just select and drop them to the eaxTerm window, they will be added to the library and ready for you to execute or modify them.
>
>To move eaxTerm window, just click on it, and move!
>
>If you like this program or not, please send an e-mail to me, including your thoughts and questions.
